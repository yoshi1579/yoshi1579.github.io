    First of all, overall I liked this course because I got a confident using C++ and learned briefly about object oriented programming. 
    During the first several weeks, we learned the basic of c++ like pointer, pass by reference and so on. I felt that it was a bit slow
    since I already knew most of the basic knowledge of c++. However, even though the pace of the class was slow, our professor taught us 
    some extra stuff like docker, Travis CI, and unit testing(google test). Since I wasn't really familliar with docker and Travis CI,
    I enjoyed learning those. Also, at the end of the semester, our professor taught us polymorphism and virtual function, which is very 
    important for object oriented programming and software design. 
    I personaly enjoyed reading those weekly reading materials, which explained the detail about OOP and the principle of how to design 
    software. For example, what is the good software design? The answer from the article was "the code is extendable, but no need to 
    modify previous codes when new functinalities are added." 
    Also, the textbook explains well for OOP design, so if you have a time I recommend to reading it.

  - You will learn the detail of c++ like l-value, r-value, pointer, how vector is implemented, and so on.
  - You can learn a bit about docker, travis CI, and git.

  - You will learn OOP design, but not so much only during last several weeks. So you have to learn by yourself by 
    reading the textbook and weekly articles.
