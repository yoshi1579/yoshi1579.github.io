    First of all, overall I liked this course because I got a confident using C++ and learned briefly about object oriented programming. 
    During the first several weeks, we learned the basic of c++ like pointer, pass by reference and so on. I felt that it was a bit slow
    since I already knew most of the basic knowledge of c++. However, even though the pace of the class was slow, our professor taught us 
    some extra stuff like docker, Travis CI, and unit testing(google test). Since I wasn't really familliar with docker and Travis CI,
    I enjoyed learning those. Also, at the end of the semester, our professor taught us polymorphism and virtual function, which is very 
    important for object oriented programming and software design. 
    I personaly enjoyed reading those weekly reading materials, which explained the detail about OOP and the principle of how to design 
    software. For example, what is the good software design? The answer from the article was "the code is extendable, but no need to 
    modify previous codes when new functinalities are added." 
    Also, the textbook explains well for OOP design, so if you have a time I recommend to reading it.

  Since from this Thursday to Sunday I was in Boston, I missed several classes. So now I have to struggle to catch up. 
  Besides, tomorrow I am having an exam from virtualization class, which is one of the most difficult class I've ever had...

  Even though next week is thanks giving week, probably I will spend most of the time to finish up the homework from OOP class
  and an open source project from my virtualization class. To be honest, the open source project is really difficult to the 
  point where I don't know what to do. I have to pick some of the issues in a git hub repo that has to be somewhat related to 
  containerlization or virtualization, and work on their bug fix tasks. However, this is very tricky since we have to understand
  the source code first.
