<p class="tab"> 
	I noticed that we will use many tools such as docker, gtest, and so on in this class, so by the end of this semester, I would like to master how to use those tools and also understand why we use them. 
	Also, even though I have already learned object oriented programming at my previous college, some of the concepts are still not clear to me. Thus, throughout this class, I want to fully understand those unclear concepts.

	Since I am an international student, I am not really good at writing English, 
	so by writing this blog, hopefully I can improve my writing skill, which is very important to work in software industry as our professor mentioned.

	Since the UT career fair is coming up in September, I will brush up my resume and practice technical interview
	by using LeetCode, which has a lot of practice coding problems. Also, there is a career fair in Boston for international students,
	so I will start preparing for the career fair as well.

</div>
</h2>
<p class = "tab">
	We looked at the first c++ code during this Wednesday class, but the code was simply printing "hello world" and I felt the class was a bit slow.
	However, during this Friday class, we learned how to use docker and how to run the Hello world program we discussed this Wednesday from Linux OS with Mac laptop.
	Since docker is new to me, I got really interested in docker and felt that I want to learn more about it.
