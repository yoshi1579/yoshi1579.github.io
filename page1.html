<b> 1. What are your expectations of the class? </b><br>
<p class="tab"> 
	I hope to learn quite a lot about the manipulation of objects, and especially the complex topics that I still have a fairly weak grasp on (such as inheritance or templating). I also expect to learn a bit about project management and workflow, two topics with which I am utterly unfamiliar.
 </p>
 
<b> 2. What did you do this past week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I did almost nothing that was not school related.
</p>
 
<b> 3. What's in your way? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	There aren't a whole lot of hard blocks in my way right now, but there are a number of difficulties that I must overcome shortly. For starters, this is my first semester at UT, and I am still very much in the process of coming to terms with all of the life changes that have accompanied my move and my change of schools. It is bound to be a busy time for me, and I hope that I am able to adapt to the degree that I need in order to succeed.
</p>

<b> 4. What will you do next week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	Next week class gets into swing (if not full swing), and I will probably find myself spending most of my time eking out a schedule and figuring out precisely what my routine will be on campus each day. I will also probably be spending a lot of time studying for the LSAT on the 16th (my dream is to become a CS patent attorney).
</p>

<b> 5. What's my experience of the class? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	This first week has been a very strange one, but enough has happened that I think I'm getting a feel for how the class will normally proceed. Having a quiz on the second day of class was certainly a surprise; I can see that we will not be messing around.
	<br> Dr. Downing hasn't called on me yet, but I can tell it's only a matter of time before he gets around to it. Being put on the spot in such a big way, and being asked to surmise things about stuff I may never have seen before or thought about in my life, is certainly somewhat intimidating. I don't think perfectly when under public scrutiny, but I guess nobody does. There's nothing to do about it, though, but wait for my turn and hope I don't make a complete fool of myself.
</p>

<b> 6. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </b><br>
<p class = "tab">
	I'm new to using git, so I found the following webpage extremely useful for explaining many of the basics of using git via terminal: <a href = "https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/wiki/Using-Git-with-Terminal"> https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/wiki/Using-Git-with-Terminal </a>
