	I noticed that we will use many tools such as docker, gtest, and so on in this class, so by the end of this semester, I would like to master how to use those tools and also understand why we use them. 
	Also, even though I have already learned object oriented programming at my previous college, some of the concepts are still not clear to me. Thus, throughout this class, I want to fully understand those unclear concepts.

	I started working on an open project which is a magazine Android app written in Java.

	Since I am an international student, I am not really good at writing English, 
	so by writing this blog, hopefully I can improve my writing skill, which is very important to work in software industry like our professor mentioned.

</div>
</h2>
<p class = "tab">
	Next week class gets into swing (if not full swing), and I will probably find myself spending most of my time eking out a schedule and figuring out precisely what my routine will be on campus each day. I will also probably be spending a lot of time studying for the LSAT on the 16th (my dream is to become a CS patent attorney).

</div>
</h2>
<p class = "tab">
	This first week has been a very strange one, but enough has happened that I think I'm getting a feel for how the class will normally proceed. Having a quiz on the second day of class was certainly a surprise; I can see that we will not be messing around.
	<br> Dr. Downing hasn't called on me yet, but I can tell it's only a matter of time before he gets around to it. Being put on the spot in such a big way, and being asked to surmise things about stuff I may never have seen before or thought about in my life, is certainly somewhat intimidating. I don't think perfectly when under public scrutiny, but I guess nobody does. There's nothing to do about it, though, but wait for my turn and hope I don't make a complete fool of myself.

	I'm new to using git, so I found the following webpage extremely useful for explaining many of the basics of using git via terminal: <a href = "https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/wiki/Using-Git-with-Terminal"> https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/wiki/Using-Git-with-Terminal </a>
