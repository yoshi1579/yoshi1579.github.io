	I worked on the first assginment from this OOP class and almost finished it. However, 
	during the last class, our professor mentioned about meta cache for HackerRank, and 
	I could not figure out how to put such cache before running my code. So I am planning
	to visit TA's office hour to ask about it.

	During last semester, I was taking CS 439, one of the hardest class in UT, and realized
	that I had no time to hang out with my friends since I was trying to get A from that class.
	However, due to lacking socializing, I did not enjoy the semester at all. So this semester, 
	I am trying to attend Japanese Association to meet more friends, which leads to a little 
	bit lacking time for doing my homework.

<p class = "tab">
	I am having three interviews from Japanese IT companies next week, and also there is a CNS career fair.
	So I will be really busy searching for my full time position since I am graduating next year.

<p class = "tab">. S
	Since I am having a lot of intervies next week, including technical ones, the first assigment
	helps me a lot to get used to those quizzes which make me to use some logic to optimize codes.
	Also, I realized that travis CI is very useful for formatting and testing.

<p class = "tab">
	I realized that there is a special career fair for CS students with high GPA named Focs Career fair 
	(https://www.cs.utexas.edu/giving-collaboration/focs/focs-career-brunch). I think this is one of the
	reason why it is good to keep GPA high, so not slacking off for non-cs classes is pretty important.
