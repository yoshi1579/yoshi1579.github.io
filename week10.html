    I have been working on a virtualization homework which is dealing with hypervisor. It was almost as difficult as 
    CS 439 project since we had to deal with page table and virtual memory. In addition, we had to implement EPT 
    (extended page table), which is used for virtual machine to create a map between VM's physical address to 
    host machine's physical address.

  Right now I am having trouble with the Darwin homework from OOP class since for this assignment, we have to think about 
  design for how each class interacts. The problem that I am facing is that, according to one of software design principles,
  which I forgtot its name, with good design, when we have to add new features, we only have to extend the previous code,
  instead of modifying it. So the problem is that the instruction of Darwin homework said we do not need to use inheritance.
  However, if we want to add new instructions in the future, without using inheritance and virtual function, we have to 
  modify our either switch statement or if else statements. Also, the instruction said that we cannot use getter and setters.
  I totally understand why it is not good idea to use them, but our solution is to use pass by reference instead. In this
  case, if a parent class change its function's passing arguments, its child class's function also need to be changed to 
  take the new arguments. Is there any better way to avoid using getter and setters?

  Next week I am having several interviews with US companies in Tokyo. So actually I bought a iPhone 6s for that since
  it is a phone interview.(I had a really crappy cell phone with which I cannot even hear what people are saying over 
  the phone.)

  This week we learned how vector in c++ is implemented. Especially, how its constructors are implemented(move, copy assignment
  copy constructor and so on). Also, we had a tech talk form under armer, which was really interested in a way that what we 
  are learning in OOP class especially designing aspects are really important even in the actual software industry.

  In my virtualization class, as a project we have to contribute to an open source project, and I realized that working on
  open source projects are a lot like working in an actual IT company since we have to use git and make pull request and
  read actual codes being used in business.
