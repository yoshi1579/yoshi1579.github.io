    I was working on the Darwin assignment this past week. I came to realize that designing how each class communicates
    is very tricky. We have to consider that, in the future, if we have to add new feature, for example new instructions
    in darwin homework, our code should simply let us extend it, but not to modify its previous codes. I thought it's 
    better to use inheritance and virtual function to make our code extendable, instead of using switch statement for 
    each creature's instruction. However, the assignment said we do not need to use inheritance, so I just kept our 
    switch statement. Also, whenever we tried to avoid getter and setters, we ended up passing arguments by reference. 
    I feel like if we want to change function signature in the future, passing by reference is as bad as getter and 
    setter. However, we could not come up with better solutions.

  Next week, I am going to Boston to attend one of the biggest career fairs for Japanese and English billinguals.
  I plan to have several final interviews with Japanese and US IT companies at Boston, so I have to start preparing for 
  it. However, currently, I have an exam from Algorithm class and a huge open source project from virtualization class.
  So I have to manage my time efficiently this week, so that I can focus on the career fair and also not to make bad 
  grades for Algorithm and virtualization classes.

  Next week I am having the second exam from algorithm class, which covers Dijkstra and net work flow algorithm. 
  Since the last exam was difficult, I have to prepair for this one a lot as well.

  This week we learned virtual function and how inheritance works. We learned that in Java, if a child class is calling,
  let's say function 'g', and its arguments are different from its parent, then even though a user is calling 'g' with 
  a child instance, if the passed argument matches with 'g' in the parent, 'g' in the parent gets called. 
  This might causes trouble if there are so many inheritance because we never know that somewhere in the inheritance 
  function 'g' is defined.

  If you are Japanese and English billingual, then I highly recommend to go to Boston Career forum, in which there will be 
  over 200 companies including US and Japanese companies.
