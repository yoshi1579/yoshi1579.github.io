    I was working on the Darwin assignment this past week. I came to realize that designing how each class communicates
    is very tricky. We have to consider that, in the future, if we have to add new feature, for example new instructions
    in darwin homework, our code should simply let us extend it, but not to modify its previous codes. I thought it's 
    better to use inheritance and virtual function to make our code extendable, instead of using switch statement for 
    each creature's instruction. However, the assignment said we do not need to use inheritance, so I just kept our 
    switch statement. Also, whenever we tried to avoid getter and setters, we ended up passing arguments by reference. 
    I feel like if we want to change function signature in the future, passing by reference is as bad as getter and 
    setter. However, we could not come up with better solutions.

  Next week, I am going to Boston to attend one of the biggest career fairs for Japanese and English billinguals.
  I plan to have several final interviews with Japanese and US IT companies at Boston, so I have to start preparing for 
  it. However, currently, I have an exam from Algorithm class and a huge open source project from virtualization class.
  So I have to manage my time efficiently this week, so that I can focus on the career fair and also not to make bad 
  grades for Algorithm and virtualization classes.

  Next week I am having several interviews with US companies in Tokyo. So actually I bought a iPhone 6s for that since
  it is a phone interview.(I had a really crappy cell phone with which I cannot even hear what people are saying over 
  the phone.)

  This week we learned how vector in c++ is implemented. Especially, how its constructors are implemented(move, copy assignment
  copy constructor and so on). Also, we had a tech talk form under armer, which was really interested in a way that what we 
  are learning in OOP class especially designing aspects are really important even in the actual software industry.

  In my virtualization class, as a project we have to contribute to an open source project, and I realized that working on
  open source projects are a lot like working in an actual IT company since we have to use git and make pull request and
  read actual codes being used in business.
