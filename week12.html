    So this weekend I went to Boston to attend one of the biggest career fairs for Japanese English billinguals.
    I got a full time offer from Goldman Sachs. Its position is software engineer and its office location is Tokyo.
    I wasn't really expecting getting a full time offer from trading companies, right now I am trying to gather 
    information about Golaman sachs's software engineer position, such as what kind of team they have, what will be
    my career path in Goldman Sachs, and etc. I also had interview with Amazon Japan and Apple. I also consider joining
    Amazon Japan, but they only offered my an internship position. So if I take their internship, then my graduation date
    will be delayed. Now I have to decide either join Goldman Sachs or Amazon Japan internship...

  Since from this Thursday to Sunday I was in Boston, I missed several classes. So now I have to struggle to catch up. 
  Besides, tomorrow I am having an exam from virtualization class, which is one of the most difficult class I've ever had...

	<span style="font-size: 19px;"> 3. What will you do next week? </span>
</div>
</h2>
<p class = "tab">
  Even though next week is thanks giving week, probably I will spend most of the time to finish up the homework from OOP class
  and an open source project from my virtualization class. To be honest, the open source project is really difficult to the 
  point where I don't know what to do. I have to pick some of the issues in a git hub repo that has to be somewhat related to 
  containerlization or virtualization, and work on their bug fix tasks. However, this is very tricky since we have to understand
  the source code first.

  Since I was in Boston, I could not attend the class.

  I realized that I start getting good at coding interviews. Come to think of it, working on the practice called "cracking the 
  coding interview" in HackerRank helped me a lot to improve the skill for those interviews. So I strongly recommend for those 
  who worry about coding interviews to work on the practice.
