	I worked on the voting assignment from OOP class. 
  The fact that the homework is very similar to those technical interviews from IT 
  companies helps me a lot to get prepared for the next week interview that I am getting. 
  It is relatively easy to pass the first and second test of HackerRank, but to pass the 
  last test I really have to think about optimization, which makes me to learn a lot.

  Right now, I get confused with setting up Travis CI and 
  makefile for the voting assignment. I will go to TAs office hour to figure that out.

<p class = "tab">
	Next week I am going to have several interviews with US and Japanese IT companies, 
  so I will practice more coding problems beforehand. Also, the voting assignment is due Thursday,
  so I will finish up that. If I have a time, I would probably attend Japanese conversation table at union.

	This week I learned a lot of things. For example, I didn't know that push_front 
  is slower than push_back with vector. Also, I did not know that increasing the size 
  of deque is cheaper than that of vector. Since technical interviews with IT companies 
  make us to use some sort of data structures, it is very helpful to know all the 
  advantage and disadvantages of each data structure.

</div>
</h2>
<p class = "tab">
	My-pick-up-of-the-week is that we should stop using i++ by itself, since compiler 
  will automatically change it to ++i!!!!! Previously, I thought I understand the difference between i++ and ++i,
  yet after professor downing explained it, now I realized there were some parts I did not fully grasp.
