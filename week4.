	This past week I learned l-value, which can return its address, and r-value, which cannot return its address. 
  For example, ++i = 2 will compile, but i++ = 3 won't compile because i++ will make a copy of i and return the copy, 
  which is a r-value. I have already learned post and pre increment while I was in my previous college, yet I realized that I did not fully understand what
  was actually going on.

  I've almost finished the second assignment, but I get confused with the makefile from the first assignment. So, for the 
  first assignment, there is a directory named examples, and its makefile has a command for the examples directory. When I checked 
  the contents inside of the examples directory, there were .gcov file and some other files which I did not create by myself. 
  So for the second assignment, should I make a directory named examples?

	Since I have a interview with Microsoft, I will practice more coding problems. I am senior now, so it is almost time for 
  me to decide where I am going to get a job, either in Japan or the US. If I actually get a internship from Microsoft, 
  it will be very tough decision for me since I have already gotten a offer from some Japanese IT companies.

<p class = "tab">
	This week I learned a lot of things. For example, I didn't know that push_front 
  is slower than push_back with vector. Also, I did not know that increasing the size 
  of deque is cheaper than that of vector. Since technical interviews with IT companies 
  make us to use some sort of data structures, it is very helpful to know all the 
  advantage and disadvantages of each data structure.
  Also, I understand how exceptions work in Java, but not in c++ and our professor explained very well about 
  the difference of exception between those two.

<p class = "tab">
	I noticed that the FoCS career fair, which is for students with high GPA and honors students, is really good place for
  getting a interview with those big IT companies, such as Microsoft, Facebook and so on compared to the regular UT CNS Career
  fair. That is because lines for those popular IT companies, Google, Microsoft and etc, are much shorter and recruiters are more
  interested in us during the career fair than the regular one. I really recommend trying not to sluck off non-CS classes and 
  keep GPA as high as possible.
