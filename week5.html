    This week I had an interview with Microsoft, which includes both technical and behavioral questions.
    To be honest, I did not do well during the technical questions since it was my first experience 
    having an interview on the U.S, xand even though the question was easy, I was not calm enough to
    get the right answer. The question was simply to print all combinations of small and capital letters
   of input string. I regret that I should have practice more coding problems.

<p class = "tab">
 I thought that my interview wouldn't go bad, but I guess lack of coding practice was on my way.
 From next time, I will practice technical interview more.

</div>
</h2>
<p class = "tab">
  Next week I will focus on my OOP class more since this class actually helps me to improve technical interview skill. 
  For example, in order to get full credit from HackerRank assignment, we actually have to think about optimization 
  a lot. Next week I have several interviews with Japanese IT companies, so I will get ready for it this time.

</div>
</h2>
<p class = "tab">
  This week we learned the details of array and pointer in C++. Well that sounds really basic, but actually I was surprised 
  By the fact that I did not fully understand those details. For example, int array [] ... sizeof(array) is not equal to 
  sizeof(&array [0]). Another example will be that there is a type of pointer like const int* const p. I know the basic of 
  pointer, but when I saw that expression I realized there are more details.

</div>
</h2>
<p class = "tab">
  Since I had a bad experience with my technical interview, I really recommend to read the book named cracking coding
  interviews,which my friend recommended to me. I started reading it and I felt I should have read this book before my 
  interview. Also about my pick-of-this-week from my class, I learned that one of the benefits of using C++ instead of Java is that it can make some runtime 
  Error into compile time error, which is a lot easier to debug.
