    This past week I had an exam of my Algorithm class. It was tough, but I managed to solve most of the problems. 
    However, I could not finish the last question because I misunderstood the end time of th exam. Since the exam
    covered Dynamic programming, I felt I wanted to take the exam before my technical interview with Microsoft.

 Since these days I hanged out with my friends a lot, I am kind of behind on my assignments and preparation for exams
 coming up next weeek. Last semester I sufferred from cs 439(OS) and did not have time to socialize, yet if I socialize
 a lot, then I will be behind on my homework. I should improve my time management skill more.

</div>
</h2>
<p class = "tab">
  Next week I am having the first exam from this OOP class. It seems that we have to actually code during the exam and
  submit it online. I like this kind of testing style since it is similar to actual technical interviews with tech
  companies.

</div>
</h2>
<p class = "tab">
  This week we learned function template, class, friend. I felt that these topic were a little bit too basic. Since there
  are a lot of good tutorials online teaching those topics. However, our professor covered those materials very thoroughly,
  so it was worth attending classes of this week.

	<span style="font-size: 19px;"> 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </span>
</div>
</h2>
<p class = "tab">
  My pick-of-the-week is that if you want to have all variables public, then you should use struct. Otherwise, it is better
  to use class. Also, Java does not have function template like c++, so when Java tries to imitate what function template does,
  it has to create a lot of functions for each data types.
