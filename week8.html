    This past week I had an exam of my Virtualization class. It was tough, since all questions were open-ended. 
    For example, one of the questions was asking what kind of hardware support I would add if I want to eliminate
    a disadvantage of DPDK, which is consuming a lot of CPU power. I did study hard for the exam, but questions 
    were testing if I truly understand each concept of virtualization and also, I can apply those knowledge to come
    up with a solution for new features. So I had hard time answering them.
    Also, I had a coding challege from Goldman Sachs. I think I did well with that since its platform was Hacker Rank and
    I was used to using it in OOP class.

  I received a result of my interview with Microsoft and it turned that I could not proceed to the next step.
  I have already received one full time offer from Japanese IT company, but still haveing a hard time getting
  a job in the U.S. I wonder how many percentage of international students get a full time job here.

  Currently I am working on the project 3 from OOP class and having hard time to understand the meaning of negative
  inputs. So I will go to a TA's office hour and ask about it.

  This week we learned how allocator, such as vector, works in C++. If we use new with pre-defined type, then it takes
  O(1). However if we use it with user-defined type, it will take O(n) since it calls constructor n times. 
  If vector is used to construct an array with user-defined type, it won't call constructor n times, but instead
  it will simply give us enough space from heap.

</div>
</h2>
<p class = "tab">
  I think we should attend those events held by IT companies more in UT since I could take a coding challenge from Goldman Sachs
  by just attending their meeting and apply their internship online. Even though I could not proceed with the internship with 
  Microsoft, I think I should keep looking for internship opportunities because opportunities are everywhere. 
  All I have to do is look around..
