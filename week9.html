    I have been working on an assignment from virtualization, which is about implementing a hypervisor for virtualizing a machine.
    This class has been almost as difficult as CS 439, since we have to deal with virtual memory and even more difficult mechanism.

  I had several coding exams from companies, but so far I haven't done well for any of those. I feel that more and more
  if I pracitice coding with HackerRank or LeetCode, I will be better at those coding interview. Since I just had a 
  coding exam from Amazon Japan and I could not solve its last problem, I am going to share it here. 
  The problem was to find the shortest path in n*n grid from start to its goal. However, there will be a multiple walls, 
  which you cannot go through and also multiple items which you have to collect all before reaching to the goal.
  Now come to think of it, I could use BSF to find a shortest path to an item and repeat that process till collecting
  all the items and then execute BSF one more time for the goal. But since I did not have enough time, I could not 
  finish the question.

  This week we learned mostly about the detail of constructors in c++. What I did not know was r-value reference, move constructor.
  It was confusing for the first time, but gradually I started understand why we need it and how does it work.
  Depending on which constructor is used, copy constructor, assignment constructor, move constructor and so on, it results in
  different running times.

<p class = "tab">
  I really recommend for those who are going to have coding interviews to read a book named "Cracking coding interview", which
  is I think super helpful.
